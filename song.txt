my fav song

name: Anything
singer: Example


Can't believe we both let it fade away
I wanna stay for another day
If you wanna save us, give me a signal
Anything will do
Can't believe we both let it fade away
I wanna stay for another day
If you wanna save us, give me a signal
Anything will do


I used to sleep like a baby
Now I lay awake at night thinking 'bout my lady
Maybe I should take a bite, maybe I should take a plunge
Maybe I should cancel all my flights
Take a right turn, left is just a place to run
From my demons, no one understands me
Better than my girl, 'cept my family
And we hanging by a thread
I go to turn my head
Think twice, maybe
Take another roll of the dice
